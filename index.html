    <h3 class="title">Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry - The little prince</h3>
    <br />
    <h4>TO LEON WERTH</h4>
    <p>
      I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating
      it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in
      the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything,
      even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where
      he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not
      enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up
      grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it.
      And so I correct my dedication:
    </p>
    <h4>TO LEON WERTH WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY</h4>
    <hr />
    <h3 class="title">I</h3>
    <p>
      Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book,
      called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a
      picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a
      copy of the drawing.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/hroznys.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <br />
    <p>
      In the book it said:
      <i>
        "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After
        that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months
        that they need for digestion."</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some
      work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My
      Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
    </p>
    <br />
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/klobouk.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <br />
    <p>
      I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
      drawing frightened them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they answered:
      <i>"Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa
      constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able
      to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa
      constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need
      to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
    </p>
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/slon.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <p>
      The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my
      drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and
      devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That
      is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent
      career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing
      Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything
      by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever
      explaining things to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have
      flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography
      has been very useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from
      Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great
      many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have
      lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them intimately, close at
      hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried
      the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always
      kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true
      understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:
    </p>
    <i>"That is a hat."</i>
    <p>
      Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval
      forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to
      him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up
      would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h1 class="title">II</h1>
    <p>
      So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to,
      until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years
      ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a
      mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs
      all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely
      enough drinking water to last a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from
      any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a
      raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at
      sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:
    </p>
    <i>"If you please--draw me a sheep!"</i>
    <i>"What!"</i>
    <i>"Draw me a sheep!"</i>
    <p>
      I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I
      looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small
      person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may
      see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my
      drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.
    </p>
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/malyPrinc.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <p>
      That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my
      painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw
      anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of
      my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand
      miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to
      be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue
      or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a
      child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human
      habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:
    </p>
    <i>"But--what are you doing here?"</i>
    <p>
      And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter
      of great consequence:
    </p>
    <i>"If you please--draw me a sheep..."</i>
    <p>
      When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it
      might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger
      of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen.
      But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography,
      history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little
      crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:
    </p>
    <i>"That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep..."</i>
    <p>
      But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I
      had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside.
      And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with:
    </p>
    <i
      >"No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa
      constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very
      cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a
      sheep. Draw me a sheep."</i
    >
    <p>So then I made a drawing.</p>
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/nemocnyBeranek.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <p>He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p>
    <i>"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."</i>
    <p>So I made another drawing.</p>
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/Beran.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <p>My friend smiled gently and indulgently.</p>
    <i
      >"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It
      has horns."</i
    >
    <p>So then I did my drawing over once more.</p>
    <p>But it was rejected too, just like the others.</p>
    <i>"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."</i
    >
    <br><img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/staryBeranek.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <br>
    <p>And I threw out an explanation with it.</p>
    <i>"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."</i>
    <p>
      I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:
    </p>
    <i
      >"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will
      have to have a great deal of grass?"</i
    ><i>"Why?"</i>
    <i>"Because where I live everything is very small..."</i>
    <i
      >"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small
      sheep that I have given you."</i
    >
    <p>He bent his head over the drawing.</p>
    <i>"Not so small that--Look! He has gone to sleep..."</i>
    <p>And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2 class="title">III</h2>
    <p>
      It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who
      asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It
      was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was
      revealed to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my
      airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:
    </p>
    <br>
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/princSala.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <br><i>"What is that object?"</i
    ><i
      >"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my
      airplane."</i
    >
    <p>And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.</p>
    <p>He cried out, then:</p>
    <i>"What! You dropped down from the sky?"</i>
    <p>"Yes," I answered, modestly.</p>
    <i>"Oh! That is funny!"</i>
    <p>
      And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which
      irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.
    </p>
    <p>Then he added:</p>
    <i>"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"</i>
    <p>
      At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of
      his presence; and I demanded, abruptly:
    </p>
    <i>"Do you come from another planet?"</i>
    <p>
      But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes
      from my plane:
    </p>
    <i>"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."</i>
    <p>
      And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my
      sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his
      treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about
      the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on
      this subject.
    </p>
    <i
      >"My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live,' of
      which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?"</i
    >
    <p>After a reflective silence he answered:</p>
    <i
      >"The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at
      night he can use it as his house."</i
    ><i
      >"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that
      you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to."</i
    >
    <p>But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:</p>
    <br>
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/malyPrincHvezdy.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <br><i>"Tie him! What a queer idea!"</i
    ><i
      >"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and
      get lost."</i
    >
    <p>My friend broke into another peal of laughter:</p>
    <i>"But where do you think he would go?"</i
    ><i>"Anywhere. Straight ahead of him."</i>
    <p>Then the little prince said, earnestly</p>
    <i>"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"</i>
    <p>And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:</p>
    <i>"Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far..."</i>
    <hr />
    <h1 class="title">IV</h1>
    <p>
      I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the
      planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!
    </p>
    <p>
      But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in
      addition to the great planets--such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus--to
      which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of
      which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the
      telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a
      name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, "Asteroid 325".
    </p>
    <p>
      I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little
      prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.
    </p>
    <p>
      This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a
      Turkish astronomer, in 1909.
    </p>
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/pozorovatelHvezdy.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <p>
      On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the
      International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was
      in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.
    </p>
    <p>Grown-ups are like that...</p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish
      dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change
      to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all
      over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time
      everybody accepted his report.
    </p>
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/matematikStary.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <p>
      If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of
      its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When
      you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any
      questions about essential matters. They never say to you, "What does his
      voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect
      butterflies?" Instead, they demand: "How old is he? How many brothers has
      he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?" Only
      from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you were to say to the grown-ups: "I saw a beautiful house made of rosy
      brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof," they would
      not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to
      them: "I saw a house that cost $20,000." Then they would exclaim: "Oh,
      what a pretty house that is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed
      is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a
      sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." And what
      good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and
      treat you like a child. But if you said to them: "The planet he came from
      is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace
      from their questions.
    </p>
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/matematikNovy.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <p>
      They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should
      always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.
    </p>
    <p>
      But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of
      indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of
      the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: "Once upon a time there was a
      little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than
      himself, and who had need of a sheep..."
    </p>
    <p>
      To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of
      truth to my story.
    </p>
    <p>
      For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too
      much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed
      since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe
      him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a
      friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may
      become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but
      figures...
    </p>
    <p>
      It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some
      pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never
      made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and
      the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly
      try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all
      sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no
      resemblance to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little
      prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And
      I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I fumble along as
      best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is
      something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to
      me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know
      how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like
      the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h1 class="title">V</h1>
    <p>
      As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little
      prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would
      come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in
      this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the
      baobabs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little
      prince asked me abruptly--as if seized by a grave doubt--"It is true,
      isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?"
    </p>
    <i>"Yes, that is true."</i><i>"Ah! I am glad!"</i>
    <p>
      I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little
      bushes. But the little prince added:
    </p>
    <i>"Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?"</i>
    <p>
      I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes,
      but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a
      whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one
      single baobab.
    </p>
    <p>The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.</p>
    <i>"We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said.</i
    >
    <br><img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/sloni.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <br>
    <p>But he made a wise comment:</p>
    <i>"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."</i
    ><i
      >"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat
      the little baobabs?"</i
    >
    <p>
      He answered me at once, "Oh, come, come!", as if he were speaking of
      something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental
      effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince
      lived--as on all planets--good plants and bad plants. In consequence,
      there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But
      seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness,
      until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken. Then this
      little seed will stretch itself and begin--timidly at first--to push a
      charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun. If it is only a
      sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow
      wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as
      soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.

      Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the
      little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that
      planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never
      be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the
      entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet
      is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces...
    </p>
    <i
      >"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on.
      "When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to
      attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You
      must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very
      first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they
      resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work," the
      little prince added, "but very easy."</i
    ><i
      >And one day he said to me: "You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so
      that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That
      would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes,"
      he added, "there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another
      day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe.
      I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three
      little bushes..."</i
    >
    <p>
      So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that
      planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger
      of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would
      be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am
      breaking through my reserve. "Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the
      baobabs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time,
      without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard
      over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all
      the trouble it has cost me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps you will ask me, "Why are there no other drawing in this book as
      magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been
      successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond
      myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.

      Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad
      little life... For a long time you had found your only entertainment in
      the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on
      the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:
    </p>
    <i>"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."</i
    ><i>"But we must wait," I said.</i><i>"Wait? For what?"</i
    ><i>"For the sunset. We must wait until it is time."</i>
    <p>
      At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to
      yourself. You said to me:
    </p>
    <i>"I am always thinking that I am at home!"</i>
    <p>
      Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun
      is setting over France.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the
      sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that.
      But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your
      chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling
      whenever you like...
    </p>
    <i>"One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"</i>
    <p>And a little later you added:</p>
    <i>"You know--one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..."</i
    ><i
      >"Were you so sad, then?" I asked, "on the day of the forty-four
      sunsets?"</i
    >
    <p>But the little prince made no reply.</p>

    <h1 class="title">VII</h1>
    <p>
      On the fifth day--again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep--the secret
      of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything
      to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent
      meditation on his problem, he demanded:
    </p>
    <i>"A sheep--if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?"</i
    ><i>"A sheep," I answered, "eats anything it finds in its reach." </i
    ><i>"Even flowers that have thorns?" </i
    ><i>"Yes, even flowers that have thorns." </i
    ><i>"Then the thorns--what use are they?"</i>
    <p>
      I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt
      that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was
      becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious.
      And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
    </p>
    <i>"The thorns--what use are they?"</i>
    <p>
      The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for
      me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that
      came into my head:
    </p>
    <i
      >"The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite!" </i
    ><i>"Oh!"</i>
    <p>
      There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed
      back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:
    </p>
    <i
      >"I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are naƒève. They
      reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are
      terrible weapons..."
    </i>
    <p>
      I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: "If this bolt
      still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer." Again the
      little prince disturbed my thoughts:
    </p>
    <i>"And you actually believe that the flowers--" </i
    ><i
      >"Oh, no!" I cried. "No, no, no! I don't believe anything. I answered you
      with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see--I am very busy
      with matters of consequence!"
    </i>
    <p>He stared at me, thunderstruck.</p>
    <i>"Matters of consequence!" </i>
    <p>
      He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with
      engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely
      ugly...
    </p>
    <i>"You talk just like the grown-ups!" </i>
    <p>That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly:</p>
    <i>"You mix everything up together... You confuse everything..." </i>
    <p>He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.</p>
    <i
      >"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has
      never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved
      any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And
      all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of
      consequence!' And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a
      man--he is a mushroom!" </i
    ><i>"A what?"</i><i>"A mushroom!"</i>
    <p>The little prince was now white with rage.</p>
    <i
      >"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions
      of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a
      matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much
      trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare
      between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more
      consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums? And if I know--I,
      myself--one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but
      on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some
      morning, without even noticing what he is doing--Oh! You think that is not
      important!"
    </i>
    <p>His face turned from white to red as he continued:</p>
    <i
      >"If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in
      all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy
      just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is
      there...' But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars
      will be darkened... And you think that is not important!"
    </i>
    <p>He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.</p>
    <p>
      The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what
      moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one
      planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I
      took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:
    </p>
    <i
      >"The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for
      your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will--"
    </i>
    <p>
      I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did
      not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand
      in hand with him once more.
    </p>
    <p>It is such a secret place, the land of tears.</p>

    <hr />
    <h1 class="title">VII</h1>
    <p>
      I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince's planet
      the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals;
      they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning
      they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded
      peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a
      new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely
      over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his
      planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a
      flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a
      huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge
      from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for
      her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with
      the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted her petals one
      by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the
      field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she
      wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her
      mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.
    </p>
    <p>Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.</p>
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/kvetinaPrinc.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <p>
      And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and
      said:
    </p>
    <i
      >"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are
      still all disarranged..."
    </i>
    <p>But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:</p>
    <i>"Oh! How beautiful you are!" </i
    ><i
      >"Am I not?" the flower responded, sweetly. "And I was born at the same
      moment as the sun..."
    </i>
    <p>
      The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too
      modest--but how moving--and exciting--she was!
    </p>
    <i
      >"I think it is time for breakfast," she added an instant later. "If you
      would have the kindness to think of my needs--" </i
    >
    <br>
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/zalevani.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <br>
    <p>
      And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a
      sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity--which was,
      if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for
      instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little
      prince:
    </p>
    <i>"Let the tigers come with their claws!" </i>
    <p>
      "There are no tigers on my planet," the little prince objected. "And,
      anyway, tigers do not eat weeds."
    </p>
    <i>"I am not a weed," the flower replied, sweetly. </i
    ><i>"Please excuse me..."</i
    ><i
      >"I am not at all afraid of tigers," she went on, "but I have a horror of
      drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?" </i
    ><i
      >"A horror of drafts--that is bad luck, for a plant," remarked the little
      prince, and added to himself, "This flower is a very complex creature..." </i
    >
    <br>
    <img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/vitr.jpg"
      alt=""
    />
    <br><i
      >"At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where
      you live. In the place I came from--"
    </i>
    <p>
      But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a
      seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarassed
      over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naƒève untruth,
      she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the
      wrong.
    </p>
    <i>"The screen?"</i
    ><i>"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me..." </i>
    <p>
      Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from
      remorse just the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable
      from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words
      which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.
    </p>
    <i
      >"I ought not to have listened to her," he confided to me one day. "One
      never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and
      breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know
      how to take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed
      me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity." </i
    ><br><img
      src="http://users.uoa.gr/~nektar/arts/tributes/antoine_de_saint-exupery_le_petit_prince/images/selma.jpg"
      alt=""
    /><br/>
    <p>And he continued his confidences:</p>
    <i
      >"The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to
      have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her
      radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to
      have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategems.
      Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love
      her..." </i
    ><br><img

    <hr />
    <h1 class="title">IX</h1>
    <p>
      I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a
      flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in
      perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed
      two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his
      breakfast in the morning. He also had one volcano that was extinct. But,
      as he said, "One never knows!" So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too.
      If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without
      any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes.
      That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the
      last little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to
      return. But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very
      precious to him. And when he watered the flower for the last time, and
      prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realized
      that he was very close to tears.
    </p>
    <i>"Goodbye," he said to the flower</i>
    <p>But she made no answer.</p>
    <i>"Goodbye," he said again.</i>
    <p>The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.</p>
    <i
      >"I have been silly," she said to him, at last. "I ask your forgiveness.
      Try to be happy..."</i
    >
    <p>
      He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all
      bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not
      understand this quiet sweetness.
    </p>
    <i
      >"Of course I love you," the flower said to him. "It is my fault that you
      have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you--you
      have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy... Let the glass globe be.
      I don't want it any more."
    </i>
    <br />

    <i>"But the wind--"</i>
    <i
      >"My cold is not so bad as all that... The cool night air will do me good.
      I am a flower."
    </i>
    <i>"But the animals--"</i>
    <i
      >"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish
      to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very
      beautiful. And if not the butterflies--and the caterpillars--who will call
      upon me? You will be far away... As for the large animals--I am not at all
      afraid of any of them. I have my claws."
    </i>
    <p>And, naƒèvely, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:</p>
    <i>"Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!" </i>
    <p>
      For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower.

      He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328,
      329, and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to
      his knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of them was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and
      ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple
      and majestic.

      prince coming.

    <p>And the little prince asked himself:</p>
    <i>"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?" </i>
    <p>
      He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men
      are subjects.
    </p>
    <i
      >"Approach, so that I may see you better," said the king, who felt
      consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.
    </i>
    <p>
      The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the
      entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine
      robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.
    </p>
    <i
      >"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king," the
      monarch said to him. "I forbid you to do so." </i
    ><i
      >"I can't help it. I can't stop myself," replied the little prince,
      thoroughly embarrassed. "I have come on a long journey, and I have had no
      sleep..." </i
    ><i
      >"Ah, then," the king said. "I order you to yawn. It is years since I have
      seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now!
      Yawn again! It is an order." </i
    ><i
      >"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince,
      now completely abashed. </i
    ><i
      >"Hum! Hum!" replied the king. "Then I--I order you sometimes to yawn and
      sometimes to--"
